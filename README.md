### How to use it:

1. Install it:  `npm i -g roku-boilerplate`
2. Navigate to where you want your project to be and then use: `rb <project-name>`
3. Wait for the process to finish. It will open itself in VS code using `code .`
4. Launch the app any which way you please and it will launch on the roku and take you to a screen with `Hello, World!`
5. Now you have a working base for your roku app with the file structure we use at REDspace
